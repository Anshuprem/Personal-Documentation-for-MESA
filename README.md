# Personal-Documentation-for-MESA
My arranged personal documentation for learning Mesa (Python's Agent Based Modeling) includes particular topics notes, beginner CI/CD using GitHub Actions daily logs, and sample models and created as preparation for open source contribution.
## 1. Learning Index (My Notes → Official Docs)
This table connects my notes to Mesa’s official documentation so that I always know what I studied and where it came from.

## 2. Why I Created This Repository

Mesa’s official documentation is detailed but **overwhelming** for me especially.  
I needed a place to:

- rewrite everything **in my own words**,  
- connect concepts slowly,  
- build small models step-by-step,  
- keep a **daily progress log**,  
- and prepare for future contributions for GSoC.

This repo is my personal roadmap + notes + experiments.
## 3. Example Models (Hands-On Practice)

I will implement simple Mesa models to reinforce concepts:

- Basic Agent Model  
- Grid Movement Model  
- Wolf-Sheep Predation  
- Schelling Segregation Model  
- Traffic Example  
- My own custom ABM experiments
## 4. Daily Learning Log

I record daily progress here:

[`daily-log/daily-log.md`](daily-log/daily-log.md)

Format:
according to the structure i have created.There are basically 3 parts of mesa mainly,
1.Modeling
2.Analysis
3.Visulaization
This helps track consistency and active learning.
